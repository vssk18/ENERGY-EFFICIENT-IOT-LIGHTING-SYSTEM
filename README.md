# 💡 Energy-Efficient IoT Lighting System

Low-cost, sensor-guided street / corridor lighting that dims or turns off in low-traffic periods and ramps up on motion, with a reproducible energy model and firmware.

- Hardware: 12 V LED + Arduino-style microcontroller + PIR + light sensor  
- Control: simple rule-based state machine (ambient light + presence)  
- Results: 15–25% simulated night-hour savings vs always-ON baseline

## 1. Problem

Many public and campus lights stay at full brightness all night, even when there is no one around.  
This project explores a realistic prototype that:

- Keeps **instant brightness** when people are present  
- Avoids **visible flicker** while dimming  
- Reduces **wasted on-time** in low-traffic hours
